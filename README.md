# SimpleBlogTemplate
Just a simple template for a HTML/PHP blog

Featuring a clean design and a combination of HTML/CSS/JS and PHP, it uses PHP to fetch text files from the /texts directory. 

Don't forget to enable PHP inside .html files on your Web Server, as the provided index.html file does contain PHP code.

To use simply create a directory inside the root directory and place the .txt files inside. It automatically sorts the files alphabetically and uses the name of the text files as the title of the respective blog entries. It also retrieves the respective dates and adds them to the file.
